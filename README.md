Then the app will run on the terminal on port 3000.

## Application Description
1. Assume that all the dates are in this format `YYYY-MM-DD`, so that I can use `new Date` to compare the dates and easily add days to them.
2. Assume that the params that the function receives are always a date string, I did not cover any case where the params is other than that since in a website the user will choose the date from the date input element.
3. I added an available dates file which has different test cases, you can add any new test case.
4. I added a new param to the main function which is the available dates array to test other cases as you like.
